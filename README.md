# Micro-Reddit Project from The Odin Project

From The Odin Project Ruby on Rails [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/building-with-active-record-ruby-on-rails)

In this project I focus on how models work in Rails.

Highlighted concepts:

- Starting a new Rails project
- Validations
- Associations
- Migrations
- Model and migration generators
